# Resource Access Opportunities

People value the ability to access coastal and ocean resources. Isolating what allows for this type of access is difficult, but a necessary component of humans relationship with the ocean. We isolated three key components; are people able to access the coast, are people able to go out on the water, and if they can, are the resources they seek available. This goal scores well when people are able to access the coastline, can afford to go boating, and fish stocks are thriving and available for accessing through fishing. The status for this goal ($RAO$)combines the three layers of this goal, **economic** ($e$), **coastal** ($c$) and **fisheries** ($f$) access, through a *geometric mean* to score each region ($i$) and goal for the years ($t = 2005 - 2017$).


$$ RAO_{i,t} =100*\sqrt[3]{e_{i,t}+c_{i,t}+f_{i,t}}$$

This goal was only assessed for coastal regions since that is where the people access coastal resources.
