# Sense of Place

A connection with the ocean is an important indicator of ocean health. While quantifying a feeling is a difficult endeavor, we feel it is an important aspect of measuring ocean health since this type of connection fosters stewardship. To do so, we try to capture the aspects of the coastal and marine system that people value as part of their cultural identity. This definition includes people living near the ocean and those who live far from it but still derive a sense of identity or value from the ocean.This goal scores highest when marine species which are valued by the community are doing well, when there are areas identified as special and needing long term protection, and when there is fishing enagement

We include three measures of sense of place: status of iconic species, protection of lasting special places, and fishing engagement.

## Data Layers

### Lasting Special Places

The **marine protected areas** layer was derived from the USGS Protected Areas Database. The ocean areas designated and/or associated for year-long protection into the future were selected and the percent of protected area in each region was calculated. The target is 10% of coastal state waters protected.

The **land protected areas** layer was derived from the USGS Protected Areas Database. The land area designated and/or associated for year-long protection into the future were selected and the percent of protected area in each region was calculated. The target is 17% of coastal land (1 km inland from shore) protected.

### Iconic Species

The **iconic species** layer was compiled and perfected from local expert knowledge. Iconic species are relevant to local cultural identity through a speciesâ€™ relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value.

The **species location** layer is a combination of data from Northeast Data Portal and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The data was used to create range maps, and then confirmed with local expert knowledge.

The **species status** layer is derived from NatureServe and IUCN status. The target is for all iconic species to have an International Union for Conservation of Nature conservation status of least concern.

### Fishing Engagement

The **commercial fishing engagement** layer is derived from NOAA Vulnerability Index. A high score means high engagement and is measured by the presence of commercial fishing through fishing activity as shown through permits and vessels landings. The target is 10% higher than the highest regional level

The **recreational fishing engagement** layer is derived from NOAA Vulnerability Index. A high score means high resilience and is measured by the presence of recreational fishing in relation to the population of a community. The target is 10% higher than the highest regional level

## Model

All layers are equally weighted when calculating the goal score for sense of place.
