# Livelihoods and Economies

Jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries are clearly of huge value to many people, even for those people who do not directly participate in marine-related industries. People value community identity, tax revenue, and indirect economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy. The necessity of providing for oneself and those dependent on them, generally surpasses any other needs or objectives. Without the availability of jobs with livable wages, it is likely that people will prioritize ocean health less and feel less connected to it. This goal tracks the number and quality of jobs and the amount of revenue produced across as many marine-related industries/sectors as possible through two sub-goals, Livelihoods and Economies. A score of 100 reflects productive coastal economies that avoid the loss of ocean-dependent livelihoods while maximizing livelihood quality.

## Data Layers

### Livelihoods

Annual **employment** rate changes in ocean related sectors was derived from the National Ocean Economics Program data. We calculated annual job growth rates and compared total employment that year to the average number of jobs over the previous 3 years. Because there is no absolute reference point for employment (i.e., a target number would be completely arbitrary), this layer uses a moving baseline as the reference point. The reference for regions job growth is set to be equal to or greater than the national average that year, calculated using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This reflects an implicit goal of maintaining coastal employment on short time scales, allowing for decadal or generational shifts in what people want and expect.


Annual **wages** rate changes in ocean related sectors was derived from the National Ocean Economics Program data. To control for inflation/deflation, all wages are reported in 2012 US Dollars. Annual wage growth is calculated by comparing mean annual wages to the wages of the previous year. The target for mean annual wage growth is set at 3.5%, reflecting the Nominal Wage Growth Target as set by the Federal Reserve. A score of zero is set to a 40% decline in wages.

### Economies

The coastal **gross domestic product** (GDP) layer was derived from the National Ocean Economics Program data. The annual GDP growth rate is calculated by comparing each year's GDP total to the average of the previous 3 years. The target is a 3% growth rate.

## Model

The two data layers for the Livelihoods sub-goal, **employment** and **wages**, were first scored according to their respective targets and then averaged to get the final Livelihoods sub-goal score. The Economies sub-goal score is solely dependent on the **gross domestic product** data layer. These two sub-goal scores were averaged with equal weighting to get the final Livelihoods & Economies score.
