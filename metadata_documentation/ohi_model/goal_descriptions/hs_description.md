# Habitat Services

This goal aims to measure the extent of habitat services in the form of the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats to coastal areas that people value, both inhabited (homes and other structures) and uninhabited (parks, special places, etc. and the presence of areas serving as carbon sinks.

Healthy habitats contribute to coastal protection from storm surge, flooding and sea level rise and are a key aspect of carbon storage. In the Northeast, this includes salt marsh and eelgrass habitats. Both of these habitats are also included in the Biodiversity - Habitats subgoal. We can use those same layers here. These habitats vary in their ability to protect against coastal storm surge so we apply a weighting scheme. Salt marsh is four times more protective than eelgrass in regards to coastal protection. 

## Data Layers

The **salt marsh** layer was derived from NOAA's Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP). We calculated the total salt marsh area from 1996 and included included areas identified as estuarine forested wetland, estuarine scrub/shrub wetland, estuarine emergent wetland, and estuarine aquatic beds in our analysis. We then calculated percent change each year compared to the historic 1850 coverage to quantify loss of coastal protection and carbon storage due to salt marsh loss. The target is no loss of salt marsh reference since the historical reference point.

The **eelgrass** layer was derived eelgrass data downloaded from the Northeast Ocean Data Portal and the EPA's National Coastal Condition Assessment Water Quality Index (WQI) data. For eelgrass, the current and historical eelgrass locations downloaded and then combined to create one single shapefile that indicates presence of eelgrass at any point in recent history (back to the 1980's). We have excluded "widgeongrass". The WQI data was then overlaid on top of the eelgrass maps, to identify areas of unsuitable water quality for eelgrass beds. Our target is that the Water Quality Index in all eelgrass beds is classified as “Good” by the EPA.
