**Aquaculture Development**

Not all aquaculture production facilities are built in similar areas, and the effects of facility location and production on the habitat differ greatly across regions, methods, and species produced. Generally, shellfish aquaculture is the least harmful, because there is little change to the habitat, not much extra structure needs to build, and they actual clean the water^[Rose, Julie M., et al. “Comparative Analysis of Modeled Nitrogen Removal by Shellfish Farms.” Marine Pollution Bulletin, vol. 91, no. 1, 2015, pp. 185–190., doi:10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.12.006.
]. On the other hand, shrimp production in some areas require the removal of mangroves and the growing process creates poor water quality conditions^[PaEz-Osuna, Federico. “The Environmental Impact of Shrimp Aquaculture: Causes, Effects, and Mitigating Alternatives.” Environmental Management, vol. 28, no. 1, 2001, pp. 131–140., doi:10.1007/s002670010212.].

Sustainability scores for farmed species were obtained from the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Seafood Recommendations](https://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-recommendations)^[Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch, avaliable at: https://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-recommendations]. This assessment incorporates 10 criteria: availability and robustness of data, effluent discharge, effects on habitats, use of chemicals, escapes during production, disease (pathogen, and parasite interaction), stock source, predator and wildlife moralities, and escapes during transit when calculating the overall sustainability score. We used the effects on habitats criteria to inform how much habitat alteration from aquaculture production contributes to the habitat destruction layer. The criteria assesses the impact or risk of impact the aquaculture farm has on the "ecosystem services" provided by habitat within the farm the immediate/neighboring areas.

To calculate the score for this layer we rescaled the criteria score from 0-10 to 0-1, scaled the production by multiplying it with the new criteria score, summed up all the scaled production in each region, and then divided it by the total area of the region to distribute the pressures. Since we know that aquculture production is in the early stages and will likely grow much larger than the current prodcution levels, we used a reference point of twice the current maxium of the scaled distributed production in each region, and then rescaled the pressure score 0-1.
