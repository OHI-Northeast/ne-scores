**Trampling**

Beaches and coastlines are very sensitive to disturbances, even a few individuals can cause damage (REF). As population densities along the coastlines increases, so does the mounting pressure on intertidal habitats from the presence of humans utlizing them.

We used 2010 census data downloaded from [NASA's Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/usgrid-summary-file1-2010/data-download). The GeoTiff files represent popualtion densities in 1 km^{2} grids. To focus on populations that would contribute coastal trampling pressure, we selcted for areas within 25 miles of the coastline. The distrubution of the population densities were very skewed, due to large cities like New York and Boston, so we log transformed the popualtion densities, since a small number of people can have a very large effect on habitats. The 99.99th quantile of raster values was used as the reference point to rescale the layer from 0 to 1, and the mean value of the raster cells within each OHI region was calculated
