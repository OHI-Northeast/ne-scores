*Goal: Biodiversity*
People value biodiversity in particular for its existence value. The risk of species extinction generates great emotional and moral concern for many people. As such, this goal assesses the conservation status of species based on the best available global data through two sub-goals: species and habitats. Species were assessed because they are what one typically thinks of in relation to biodiversity. Because only a small proportion of marine species worldwide have been mapped and assessed, we also assessed habitats as part of this goal, and considered them a proxy for condition of the broad suite of species that depend on them. For the species sub-goal, we used species risk assessments from both NatureServe and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN 2016) for a wide range of taxa to provide a geographic snapshot of how total marine biodiversity is faring, even though it is a very small sub-sample of overall species diversity (Mora et al. 2011). For the habitats sub-goal we look to measure the status of key foundational habitats in the region: Salt Marsh, eelgrass, and Seabed Habitats (full list of habitats included below). We calculate each of these subgoals separately and weight them equally when calculating the overall goal score.

*Subgoal: Habitat*
The habitat subgoal measures the average condition of marine habitats present in each region that provide critical habitat for a broad range of species (salt marsh, eelgrass, and seabed habitats). This subgoal is considered a proxy for the condition of the broad suite of marine species that rely on these habitats.

Data availability remains a major challenge for species and habitat assessments. We compiled and analyzed the best available data in both cases, but key gaps remain. Although several efforts have been made in recent years to create or compile the data necessary to look at the status and trends of marine habitats, most efforts are still hampered by limited geographical and temporal sampling (Joppa et al. 2016). In addition, most marine habitats have only been monitored since the late 1970s at the earliest, many sites were only sampled over a short period of time, and very few sites were monitored before the late 1990s so establishing reference points was difficult. eelgrasses were the most data-limited of the habitats included in the analysis.

*Saltmarsh*

For salt marsh habitats we used NOAA's Coastal Change Analysis Program data (C-CAP) to derive an estimate of salt marsh loss from 1996 through 2010 and a collection of historical loss estimates to estimate the overall loss of salt marsh habitat coverage since ~1880. The NOAA C-CAP data are land cover raster data (.img format) available for the years 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2010 for each state. To measure salt marsh habitats coverage in each of these years we included the following C-CAP land classifications: Estuarine Forested Wetland (16), Estuarine Scrub/Shrub Wetland (17), Estuarine Emergent Wetland (18), Estuarine Aquatic Bed (23). For each time step we remove all land cover cells that are not in those four categories. We then calculated the % gained or lost within each of these classifications in each time step, using a linear interpolation between all time steps. We then incorporate the historical areas lost estimates to represent the full loss of salt marsh habitat since ~1850s.
