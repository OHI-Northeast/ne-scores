*Goal: Biodiversity*
People value biodiversity in particular for its existence value. The risk of species extinction generates great emotional and moral concern for many people. As such, this goal assesses the conservation status of species based on the best available global data through two sub-goals: species and habitats. Species were assessed because they are what one typically thinks of in relation to biodiversity. Because only a small proportion of marine species worldwide have been mapped and assessed, we also assessed habitats as part of this goal, and considered them a proxy for condition of the broad suite of species that depend on them. For the species sub-goal, we used species risk assessments from both NatureServe and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN 2016) for a wide range of taxa to provide a geographic snapshot of how total marine biodiversity is faring, even though it is a very small sub-sample of overall species diversity (Mora et al. 2011). For the habitats sub-goal we look to measure the status of key foundational habitats in the region: Salt Marsh, eelgrass, and Seabed Habitats (full list of habitats included below). We calculate each of these subgoals separately and weight them equally when calculating the overall goal score.

*Subgoal: Habitat*
The habitat subgoal measures the average condition of marine habitats present in each region that provide critical habitat for a broad range of species (salt marsh, eelgrass, and seabed habitats). This subgoal is considered a proxy for the condition of the broad suite of marine species that rely on these habitats.

Data availability remains a major challenge for species and habitat assessments. We compiled and analyzed the best available data in both cases, but key gaps remain. Although several efforts have been made in recent years to create or compile the data necessary to look at the status and trends of marine habitats, most efforts are still hampered by limited geographical and temporal sampling (Joppa et al. 2016). In addition, most marine habitats have only been monitored since the late 1970s at the earliest, many sites were only sampled over a short period of time, and very few sites were monitored before the late 1990s so establishing reference points was difficult. eelgrasses were the most data-limited of the habitats included in the analysis.

*Eelgrass*

Data available to measure the extent and condition of eelgrass habitats in the Northeast through time is quite limited. As such we developed a model to assess the water quality condition in areas that are home to eelgrass habitats as a proxy for the condition of eelgrasses across the region. To gauge the extent of eelgrass across all Northeast States we first used the spatial Past Eelgrass Surveys data layer from the Northeast Data Portal to identify all locations where eelgrass has been in the past (1980 forwards). We then overlaid this location information with the EPA's National Coastal Condition Assessment Water Quality Index which measures Phosphorus, Nitrogen, Dissolved Oxygen, Water Clarity, and Chlorophyll a for each site monitored by the EPA across the region. The Water Quality Index provides data in categories of "Good", "Fair" and "Poor" for each monitoring site. We assign the following scores to each of these categories: Good = 100, Fair = 50 and Poor = 0. We then intersect the Water Quality Index monitoring sites with the current and past eelgrass beds as identified in the Northeast Data Portal using a 10km buffer to determine the water quality values where eelgrass are present. We only use sites where eelgrass presence data and water quality monitoring sites overlap within our 10km buffer and take the average score based on all overlapping points.
