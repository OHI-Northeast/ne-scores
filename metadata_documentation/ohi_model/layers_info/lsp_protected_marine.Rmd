*Goal: Sense of Place*
A connection with the ocean is an important indicator of ocean health. While quantifying a feeling is a difficult endeavor, we feel it is an important aspect of measuring ocean health since this type of connection fosters stewardship. To do so, we try to capture the aspects of the coastal and marine system that people value as part of their cultural identity. This definition includes people living near the ocean and those who live far from it but still derive a sense of identity or value from the ocean.This goal scores highest when marine species which are valued by the community are doing well, when there are areas identified as special and needing long term protection, and when there is fishing enagement

We include three measures of sense of place: status of iconic species, protection of lasting special places, and fishing engagement.

*Subgoal: Lasting Special Places*
**Marine Protected Areas**

The marine protected areas layer was derived from the USGS Protected Areas Database. The ocean areas designated and/or associated for year-long protection into the future were selected and the percent of protected area in each region was calculated. The target is 10% of coastal state waters protected.
