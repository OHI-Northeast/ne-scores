**Sea Level Rise**

The sea level rise pressure layer is derived from [satellite altimetry data](http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/sea-surface-height-products/global/msla-mean-climatology.html)^[AVISO+ Satelite Altimetry Data, MSLA - Monthly Mean and Climatology Maps of Sea Level Anomalies, <http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/sea-surface-height-products/global/msla-mean-climatology.html>]. Monthly mean sea level anomalies since 1993 track changes in sea level (mm) compared to a reference period from 1993-2012. Raw monthly data are provided on a 0.25x0.25 degree grid. These data were clipped to within 3 nautical miles of the coast, and monthly data layers were aggregated and averaged across pixels to compute mean sea level anomalies. We are using a reference point 110%  larger than the maximum value in the entire Northeast region from 1993-2017 was used to scale the layer from 0-1. The current maximum value is unlikely to be the future max, thus setting this reference point allows for an increase in sea level rise pressure into the future. All negative values were set to zero (i.e., no negative pressure), such that only positive sea level rise values mattered. The mean value of the raster cells within each OHI region was calculated.
