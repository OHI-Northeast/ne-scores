**Coastal Hardening**

Artificially hardening our coastlines is a method to protect developments along the coast from the ever increasing threats of erosion (REF1). However this is often a short sighted solution, which costs money to maintain and is detrimental to the habitat, such as narrowing of the intertidal zone or loss of saltmarsh habitats (REF 2, need a second ref). 

Data from the NOAA [Environmental Response Management Application](https://erma.noaa.gov/atlantic/erma.html#/layers=1+13763+16973+35410+491&x=-78.22196&y=38.23326&z=6&panel=layer) portal was used to calculate the percentage of armored coastline in each of the regions. We included all man made structures such as seawalls, riprap, jetties, bulkheads, etc within a 1 km distance of the coastline. The percentage hardened in each region was used directly as the pressure score for this layer.
