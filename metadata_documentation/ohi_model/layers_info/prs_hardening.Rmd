**Coastal Hardening**

Artificially hardening our coastlines is a method to protect developments along the coast from the ever increasing threats of erosion^[Gittman, Rachel K, et al. “Engineering Away Our Natural Defenses: an Analysis of Shoreline Hardening in the US.” The Ecological Society of America, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1 Aug. 2015, esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/150065.]. However this is often a short sighted solution, which costs money to maintain and is detrimental to the habitat, such as narrowing of the intertidal zone^[Dugan, Jenifer E., et al. “Ecological Effects of Coastal Armoring on Sandy Beaches.” Wiley Online Library, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd (10.1111), 3 June 2008, onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1439-0485.2008.00231.x.] or loss of saltmarsh habitats.

] portal was used to calculate the percentage of armored coastline in each of the regions. We included all man made structures such as seawalls, riprap, jetties, bulkheads, etc within a 1 km distance of the coastline. The percentage hardened in each region was used directly as the pressure score for this layer.
