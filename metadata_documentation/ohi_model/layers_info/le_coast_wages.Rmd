*Goal: Livelihoods and Economies*
Jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries are clearly of huge value to many people, even for those people who do not directly participate in marine-related industries. People value community identity, tax revenue, and indirect economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy. The necessity of providing for oneself and those dependent on them, generally surpasses any other needs or objectives. Without the availability of jobs with livable wages, it is likely that people will prioritize ocean health less and feel less connected to it. This goal tracks the number and quality of jobs and the amount of revenue produced across as many marine-related industries/sectors as possible through two sub-goals, Livelihoods and Economies. A score of 100 reflects productive coastal economies that avoid the loss of ocean-dependent livelihoods while maximizing livelihood quality.

*Subgoal: Livelihoods*

*Wages*
Annual wages rate changes in ocean related sectors was derived from the National Ocean Economics Program data. To control for inflation/deflation, all wages are reported in 2012 US Dollars. Annual wage growth is calculated by comparing mean annual wages to the wages of the previous year. The target for mean annual wage growth is set at 3.5%, reflecting the Nominal Wage Growth Target as set by the Federal Reserve. A score of zero is set to a 40% decline in wages.
