*Goal: Biodiversity*
People value biodiversity in particular for its existence value. The risk of species extinction generates great emotional and moral concern for many people. As such, this goal assesses the conservation status of species based on the best available global data through two sub-goals: species and habitats. Species were assessed because they are what one typically thinks of in relation to biodiversity. Because only a small proportion of marine species worldwide have been mapped and assessed, we also assessed habitats as part of this goal, and considered them a proxy for condition of the broad suite of species that depend on them. For the species sub-goal, we used species risk assessments from both NatureServe and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN 2016) for a wide range of taxa to provide a geographic snapshot of how total marine biodiversity is faring, even though it is a very small sub-sample of overall species diversity (Mora et al. 2011). For the habitats sub-goal we look to measure the status of key foundational habitats in the region: Salt Marsh, eelgrass, and Seabed Habitats (full list of habitats included below). We calculate each of these subgoals separately and weight them equally when calculating the overall goal score.

*Subgoal: Habitat*
The habitat subgoal measures the average condition of marine habitats present in each region that provide critical habitat for a broad range of species (salt marsh, eelgrass, and seabed habitats). This subgoal is considered a proxy for the condition of the broad suite of marine species that rely on these habitats.

Data availability remains a major challenge for species and habitat assessments. We compiled and analyzed the best available data in both cases, but key gaps remain. Although several efforts have been made in recent years to create or compile the data necessary to look at the status and trends of marine habitats, most efforts are still hampered by limited geographical and temporal sampling (Joppa et al. 2016). In addition, most marine habitats have only been monitored since the late 1970s at the earliest, many sites were only sampled over a short period of time, and very few sites were monitored before the late 1990s so establishing reference points was difficult. eelgrasses were the most data-limited of the habitats included in the analysis.

*Seabeds*
For seabed habitats we utilized the Fishing Effects model developed by the New England Fishery Management Council which measures the impacts placed on seabed habitats from fishing activity as percent disturbance based on a scale of 0 - 1, with a score of 1 representing the most disturbed. These data are available at a 5x5 km grid spatial scale for each month from 1996 - 2017. For our purposes we took the mean percent disturbance across each region and year to measure the status of the seabed habitats included in the model (see table below for all seabed habitats included in the Model). Regions with the least amount of disturbance from fishing scored the highest in this model. Seabed habitats included in the Fishing Effects Model:

*Amphipods
*Anemones
*Ascidians
*Brachiopods
*Bryozoans
*Corals & sea pens
*Hydroids
*Macroalgae
*Scallops
*Mussels
*Polychaetes
*Sponges
*Sediment
*Biogenic burrows
*Biogenic depressions
*Bedforms
*Gravel
*Shell deposits
