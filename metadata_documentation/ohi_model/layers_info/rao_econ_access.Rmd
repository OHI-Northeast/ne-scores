*Goal: Resource Access Opportunities*
People value the ability to access coastal and ocean resources. Isolating what allows for this type of access is difficult, but a necessary component of humans relationship with the ocean. We isolated two key components; are people able to to go out on the water, and if they can, are the resources they seek available. This goal scores well when people can access the coastline, can afford to go boating, and fish are thriving and available in the ocean. We include two measures of resource access oppportunity: the price of gas compared to wages, fish stock assessment sustainability, and frequent access points along the coast

*Economic Access*

The economic access layer was derived from the US Energy Information Administration and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics data. We calculated the ratio of gas prices to the median wages every year. The target for this layer is to maintain a constant ratio each year. When no change, or a negative change indicating increased economic access occurs, this results in a perfect score. If the ratio doubles, the region scores 0.
