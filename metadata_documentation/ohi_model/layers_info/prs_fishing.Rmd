**Fishing Pressure**

Spatial fishing data from Watson & Tidd (2018) were used to represent total biomass removed through fishing from 2000 to 2015. Data was provided as tons per half-degree cell. Data was translated into tons per km2 using provided information on Ocean Area in square kilometers. The fishing pressure layer represents the total amount of biomass removed by fishing through landings, discards and bycatch. Total biomass per half-degree cell within the Northeast is calculated for each year 2000 - 2015, then rescaled between 0 and 1 using the 99.9th quantile across the time series and region as a reference point, 43 tons/km2. All values greater than this were assigned a value of 1. Final pressure scores for each region and year were calculated by taking the average score of all cells within each region.
