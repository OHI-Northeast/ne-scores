*Goal: Clean Waters*
People value marine waters that are free of pollution and debris for aesthetic and health reasons. Contamination of waters comes from oil spills, chemicals, eutrophication, algal blooms, disease pathogens (e.g., fecal coliform, viruses, and parasites from sewage outflow), floating trash, and mass kills of organisms due to pollution. People are sensitive to these phenomena occurring in areas they access for recreation or other purposes as well as for simply knowing that clean waters exist. This goal scores highest when contamination from all potential sources is zero.

We include four measures of pollution in the clean waters goal: pathogens, trash, water quality, and sediment quality. This decision was meant to represent a comprehensive list of the contamination categories that are commonly considered in assessments of coastal clean waters (Borja et al. 2008) and for which we could obtain data (see data layers below).

*Water Quality*

The water quality layer is derived from the EPA Coastal Condition report which has regional data available for 2010, 2006 and 2001. The Report consists of four indices: Biological Benthic Index, Water Quality Index (Phosphorus, Nitrogen, Dissolved Oxygen, Water Clarity, Chlorophyll a), Sediment Quality Index (contaminants & toxicity), Fish Quality Index. For our water quality layer we use only the Water Quality Index component of the report which measures Phosphorus, Nitrogen, Dissolved Oxygen, Water Clarity, and Chlorophyll a for each monitoring site. For the sediment quality layer we use the Sediment Quality Index component of the report which measures contaminants & toxicity. Both the Water Quality and Sediment Quality indices provide data in categories of "Good", "Fair" and "Poor". We assign the following scores to each of these categories: Good = 100, Fair = 50 and Poor = 0. These scores are then aggregated for each region each year based on EPA-determined weights for contribution to the entire regional score. A separate score is calculated for the water quality and sediment quality layers.
