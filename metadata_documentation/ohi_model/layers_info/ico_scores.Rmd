*Goal: Sense of Place*
A connection with the ocean is an important indicator of ocean health. While quantifying a feeling is a difficult endeavor, we feel it is an important aspect of measuring ocean health since this type of connection fosters stewardship. To do so, we try to capture the aspects of the coastal and marine system that people value as part of their cultural identity. This definition includes people living near the ocean and those who live far from it but still derive a sense of identity or value from the ocean.This goal scores highest when marine species which are valued by the community are doing well, when there are areas identified as special and needing long term protection, and when there is fishing enagement

We include three measures of sense of place: status of iconic species, protection of lasting special places, and fishing engagement.

*Subgoal: Iconic Species*

The iconic species layer was compiled and perfected from local expert knowledge. Iconic species are relevant to local cultural identity through a species’ relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value.

The species location layer is a combination of data from Northeast Data Portal and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The data was used to create range maps, and then confirmed with local expert knowledge.

The species status layer is derived from NatureServe and IUCN status. The target is for all iconic species to have an International Union for Conservation of Nature conservation status of least concern.
